# Task 1: Define Constants for Roles and Labels

- **Concepts**: Variables, Constants
- **Why**: Use constants to define roles like `STUDENT` and `FACULTY`. Avoid hardcoding labels for better readability and flexibility.
- **Alternatives**:
    - **Using variables** instead of constants for flexibility if you need the labels to change dynamically. However, constants are preferable for fixed labels like `STUDENT` and `FACULTY`.
- **Best Practices**:
    - Use **UPPERCASE_NAMES** for constants.
    - Store constants in a **separate module** if they are used in multiple files.

- **Output:** At the end of this task, I got to know about variables and constants. How to define variables and constants, Why constants and variables are important, Where the can be used.
