## Task 0 : Configruration File Setup

- **Purpose**: Set up the essential configuration and data files for the system.
- **Required Files**:
    1. **`config.py`**: Store constants like roles, attendance threshold, and file paths for data storage.
    2. **`data.json`**: Store user data (name, role, attendance records) persistently.
    3. **`main.py`**: Contains the core program logic to interact with the user and call relevant functions.

- **Output:** This step is crucial to maintain our files which will be used in this project.By doing this i understand that it is useful to divide the program into separate modules so it can be used further and it makes the code more clear, easy to read, prevent hardcoding and redundency.
